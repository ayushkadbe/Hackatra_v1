## The following key problem statements are expected to be solved by participants:
---
> ### 1) Text Summarizer:
As of late, there has been a blast in the measure of text data from an assortment of sources. This volume of text is a priceless source of information and knowledge, which should be effectively summarized to be useful. In this problem, the main objective is to automatic text summarization from different types of text data sources.

**Scenario**: If an educator puts in long-form content, we would like the system to generate a summary of the text and provide a JSON output for the same. Alternatively, if there are web articles, PDFs, etc uploaded by the educator, the solution should be able to summarize the large content into bite-sized information.

> ### 2) Semantic Search:
The Semantic Web provides a common framework that allows data to be shared and reused across applications, enterprise, and community boundaries. Its objective is to convert all the unstructured documents on the web into web data. We expect the solution to work on a predefined library, and provide contextual search output based on questions asked.

**Scenario**: An educator can create a library from documents, websites, and articles which become the data source. If a student asks a question to the chatbot, the tool should provide the best possible answer with an accuracy % along with it.
