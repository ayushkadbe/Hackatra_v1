## The following key problem statements are expected to be solved by participants:
---
> ### 1) Text Summarizer:

As of late, there has been a blast in the measure of text data from an assortment of sources. This volume of text is a priceless source of information and knowledge, which should be effectively summarized to be useful. In this problem, the main objective is to automatic text summarization from different types of text data sources.

**Scenario**: If an educator puts in long-form content, we would like the system to generate a summary of the text and provide a JSON output for the same. Alternatively, if there are web articles, PDFs, etc uploaded by the educator, the solution should be able to summarize the large content into bite-sized information.

> ### 2) Semantic Search - Web:

Semantic search refers to the ability of search engines to consider the intent and contextual meaning of search phrases. Instead of trying to find exact matches for the word in the input phrase, semantic search captures broader context and relationships between words and retrieves results that are more closely related to the context of the search query.  We expect the solution to work on a predefined library, and provide contextual search output based on questions asked.

**Scenario**: The educator can define web sources to which contain subject specific information. If a student wants to learn a specific topic from the subject, the search should return a set of results which are a mixture of text, audio/video and images for the topic.

> ### 3) Semantic Search â€“ Document: 

Semantic search seeks to improve search accuracy by understanding the content of the search query. In contrast to traditional search engines, which only find documents based on lexical matches, semantic search can also find synonyms. The idea behind semantic search is to embed all entries in your corpus, which can be sentences, paragraphs, or documents, into a vector space. At search time, the query is embedded into the same vector space and the closest embedding from your corpus are found. These entries should have a high semantic overlap with the query. 

**Scenario**: An educator can create a library from documents, websites and articles which become the data source.  If a student asks a question to the chatbot, the tool should provide the best possible answer with an accuracy % along with it.
